# Student Persistence Predictor

This project integrates a **backend** built with Flask and TensorFlow and a **frontend** developed using React. It allows admins to manage machine learning models and pipelines while offering predictions on student persistence based on input data.

---

## Features

- **Admin Model Management**: Add, view, and switch between multiple models and pipelines.
- **Student Persistence Prediction**: Provides predictions based on student data.
- **Secure Access**: Admin pages are protected and accessible only after login.

---

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

### Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.8)
- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

---

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**  
   Open a terminal and move into the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Create an isolated Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Add Models and Pipelines**  
   - Save `.keras` files for TensorFlow models in the `backend/model/` folder.
   - Save `.pkl` files for pipelines in the `backend/pipeline/` folder.

6. **Start the Backend Server**  
   Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**  
   Open a terminal and move into the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Server**  
   Run the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Usage

### Admin Model Management

1. **Login**  
   Navigate to the homepage (`/`) and log in using the provided credentials.

2. **Manage Models and Pipelines**  
   Access `/admin` to:
   - View available models and pipelines.
   - Switch between models and pipelines.
   - Upload new models (`.keras`) and pipelines (`.pkl`).

3. **Add Models and Pipelines**  
   - Save new models to `backend/model/`.
   - Save new pipelines to `backend/pipeline/`.

---

### Prediction

1. Access the prediction form at `/predict`.
2. Fill in the required student data fields.
3. Submit the form to receive predictions on student persistence.
